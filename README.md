This system provides a structured and user-friendly interface to streamline business operations, ensuring real-time data synchronization and reducing manual errors.

The application consists of the following key modules:

Login Page – Secure authentication system for user access.

Home Page – Dashboard displaying key business metrics and navigation options.

Manage Users – Admin functionality to add, edit, and delete system users with role-based access.

Manage Categories – Organizes products into different categories for efficient inventory handling.

Manage Products – Allows adding, updating, deleting, and tracking stock levels.

Manage Customers – Stores and manages customer details for order processing.

Manage Orders – Facilitates order creation, processing, and invoice generation.

View Orders – Displays order history with details such as customer information, purchased products, and total cost.

Bill Generation – Automatically generates invoices (bills) for completed orders, which can be printed or saved as PDFs for record-keeping.

By leveraging a MySQL database for backend storage and Java Swing (JFrame) for the user interface, this system provides a robust and efficient solution for small to medium-sized businesses. It enhances productivity, automates billing, and ensures smooth inventory and sales management.
